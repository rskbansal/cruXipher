# Sweeping Crop Failure

- Get the hex data from the pcapng file:
```
tshark -T fields -e data.text -o data.show_as_text:TRUE -r capture.pcapng
```
- This gives a [pbm file](./data.pbm), with variable height and width.
- We tinker around with these dimensions but to no avail.
- Upon reading more into it, we try converting the data acquired [to binary](./binary_data).
- We find the length of the ppm file is 6808 bits, which has the factors `2^3 * 23 * 37`. We use [this tool](https://www.dcode.fr/binary-image) to extract the image from the bits.
- We brute force the length and width, since the number of factors isn't a lot, and get the correct height and width. We obtain the following image:
