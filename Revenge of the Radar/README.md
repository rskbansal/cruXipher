- We decompiled the [given file](./chall) to C code, and upon examining we saw that the passkey requires 3 characters (and a terminating \0 at the end).
- We wrote a [simple script](./genpwd.py) to bruteforce the passkey
- From this we are able to get "pas" as one of the passkeys ("password" also works, so I guess all that effort wasnâ€™t required).
- In any case, we now have to do a buffer overflow attack.
- Initially our exploits failed, however upon learning about socat, we find out that it requires an escape sequence, `\x16`, for the binary string input.
- We run [our new exploit](./exploit.py) and get the flag.
